# Quiz Web App

A full-featured quiz web application built using TypeScript. This app allows users to take quizzes across various courses, securely stores quiz results, and provides an admin dashboard for managing and reviewing quiz records. Anti-cheating measures are in place to ensure quiz integrity.

## Features

### Multi-course Quiz System:
- Supports quizzes for multiple courses/topics.

### Result Tracking:
- Automatically saves quiz scores and relevant data.

### Admin Dashboard:
- Admins can log in securely.
- View all student quiz records.
- Monitor performance across courses.

### Anti-Cheating:
- Tab switching during a quiz leads to automatic disqualification.
- The system gives a score of 0 if a user switches tabs during an active quiz.

## Firebase Integration

This project uses Firebase as its backend solution. Firebase is used for:
- Storing quiz data in Firestore.
- Syncing quiz results in real-time across devices.
- Seamless continuation of quizzes between devices.

Firebase also provides real-time updates to quiz results, ensuring that both users and admins have up-to-date information.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Backend:
- Firebase Firestore for data storage and real-time syncing
- Firebase Authentication for secure login and user management

### Other Tools:
- Firebase SDK for client-side communication with Firebase services
